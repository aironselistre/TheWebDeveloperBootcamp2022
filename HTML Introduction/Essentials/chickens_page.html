    The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl
    species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
    junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a
    term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A
    male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen
    and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a
    total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[4] up from more than 19 billion
    in 2011.[5] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.[5] There
    are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion,
    and in language and literature.

    Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia,
    Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[6] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe,
    the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From
    ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to
    Greece by the 5th century BC.[7] Fowl have been known in Egypt since the
    mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come
    from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
    Thutmose III.[8][9][10]

  <h2>Terminology</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an
    adult female is called a hen.[11][12] Other terms are: Biddy: a newly hatched
    chicken[13][14] Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a] Chick: a young
    chicken[15] Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[16]
    Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[17] Dunghill fowl: a
    chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[18] Pullet: a
    young female chicken less than a year old.[19] In the poultry industry, a
    pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[20] Yardbird:
    a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[21] Chicken was originally a
    term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources,
    chicken as a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic
    fowl.[22][page needed][failed verification] Chicken may also mean a chick (see
    for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[23]

  <h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Chickens are omnivores.[28] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to
    search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small
    snakes,[29] or sometimes young mice.[30] The average chicken may live for 5–10
    years, depending on the breed.[31] The world's oldest known chicken lived 16
    years according to Guinness World Records.[32] Anatomy of a chicken. Diagram
    of a chicken skull. Eggs from different breeds Roosters can usually be
    differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and
    shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which
    are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same
    breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has
    only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The
    identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the
    development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain
    hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult
    chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and
    hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles.
    Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are
    called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but
    in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a
    mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under
    the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[33] Domestic chickens
    are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are
    generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into
    trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly
    briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee
    perceived danger.

  <h3>Behavior</h3>
  <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
  <p>
    Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a
    communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual
    chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a 'pecking order', with
    dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations.
    Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this
    social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially
    younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[34]
